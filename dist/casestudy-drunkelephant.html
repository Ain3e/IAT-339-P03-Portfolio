        <p class="font-untitledsans text-base">To approach this project, we were first tasked to define our scope.
            We created a set of criteria to narrow down the different brands we could propose an intervention for. Once
            our group settled on the brand,
            we examined the site and crafted ‘How Might We’ statements to identify potential opportunities for our
            digital intervention.</p>

    <div class="col-start-1 col-span-4">
        <p class="font-untitledsans text-base">Once we settled on a statement to direct our team, we began listing ideas and
            producing low-fidelity wireframes.
            After deliberating on which ideas were the best, we began developing a mockup for the milestone with some
            basic interaction prototyping.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-start-1 col-span-4">
        <p class="font-untitledsans text-base">The main concept of our intervention was to better introduce and integrate the
            smoothie concept as users arrived onto
            the landing page and explored the products. The key interaction was a double-hover in the product listing
            page that allowed users to discover the smoothies.

    <div class="col-start-1 col-span-4">
        <p class="font-untitledsans text-base">The instructors approved the concept, but were skeptical of the clarity of the double-hover interaction, so our group was recommended to spend the last week of the project on doing a Design Sprint with a focus on user testing rather than polishing the existing design further.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-start-1 col-span-4">
        <p class="font-untitledsans text-base">To approach this sprint, our group believed that simply testing our original prototype would not give us substantial feedback so we created three variants to perform qualitative multivariate testing with a small sample of users.

    <div class="col-start-1 col-span-4">
        <p class="font-untitledsans text-base">Our user testing confirmed that the double-hover interaction was difficult to discover so we switched to a more discoverable way of informing the user. As the facilitators of the interviews, another teammate and I pulled several insights from the interviews which we used to create some final iterations on the prototype. We also discovered a major insight that made us question the validity of our initial framing.

        <p class="font-untitledsans text-base">This project was a learning experience regarding the importance of user
            interviews and testing early on in the process. If I were to do this project again, I would put more of a
            focus on developing our How Might We statements to be less leading earlier on in the process or talk to users
            of the brand as we develop the initial framing. This project also taught me a lot about communicating and rapid
            iteration with our team producing numerous ideas, sketches and wireframes throughout the process.

        second year interaction design class. We were given a vague prompt to design a small digital intervention for an ‘e-commerce lifestyle brand’.</h1>

                We created a set of criteria to narrow down the different brands we could propose an intervention for.
                Once our group settled on the brand, we examined the site and crafted ‘How Might We’ statements to identify potential opportunities for our digital intervention..</p>

        <p class="text-base font-untitledsans mt-4 font-black">Once we settled on a statement to direct our team, we began listing ideas and producing low-fidelity
            wireframes. After deliberating on which ideas were the best, we began developing a mockup for the milestone with some basic interaction prototyping.
            </p>
        <p class="text-base font-untitledsans mt-4 font-black">
            The main concept of our intervention was to better introduce and integrate the smoothie concept as users arrived onto the landing page and
            explored the products. The key interaction was a double-hover in the product listing page that allowed users to discover the smoothies.

        <p class="text-base font-untitledsans mt-4 font-black">
            The instructors approved the concept, but were skeptical of the clarity of the double-hover interaction, so
            our group was recommended to spend the last week of the project on doing a Design Sprint with a focus on user testing rather than polishing the existing design further.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base font-untitledsans mt-4 font-black">
            To approach this sprint, our group believed that simply testing our original prototype would not give us
            substantial feedback so we created three variants to perform qualitative multivariate testing with a small sample of users.

            Users who received the product in store have no understanding of the brand’s mixing idea.
            Despite 3 users having experience with the brand, none of them were aware of the smoothie concept.

        <p class="text-base font-untitledsans mt-4 font-black">
            This project was a learning experience regarding the importance of user interviews and testing early on in
            the process. If I were to do this project again, I would put more of a focus on developing our How Might We
            statements to be less leading earlier on in the process or talk to users of the brand as we develop the initial framing.
            This project also taught me a lot about communicating and rapid iteration with our team producing numerous ideas, sketches
            and wireframes throughout the process.
